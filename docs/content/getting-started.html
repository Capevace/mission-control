<p>Mission Control is a Node.js framework for building real-time dashboards. It provides a strong foundation for building web-based dashboards that synchronize data in real-time.</p>
<p>It provides the most common features out-of-the-box so you can focus on the contents of your dashboard, instead of having to build all the boilerplate stuff yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>Real-time state synchronization using services</li>
<li>User Management</li>
<li>Role-based permissions</li>
<li>HTTP &amp; WebSocket API</li>
<li>Ready-to-use default UI</li>
</ul>
<p>While Mission Control is flexible and easy to extend for more complex projects, it is also ready-to-go right after installation, which makes it perfect for small and quickly built dashboards.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about how Mission Control works, here's a section about <a href="concepts.md">Concepts</a>.</p>

<p>Installing Mission Control is very simple and works the same on any platform (though it is primarily tested on macOS).</p>

<p>Mission Control provides two ways to use out-of-the-box, and is otherwise customizable to your needs.</p>
<h3 id="small-dashboards">Small Dashboards</h3>
<p>When Mission Control is first started, it will generate a <code>.mission-control</code> folder in your home directory (<a href="cli.md#disable-init">unless</a>). This folder contains a base configuration file, an SQLite database file and a folder for your custom plugins.</p>
